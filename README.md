# Current
  - 1st screen : Source list
  - 2nd screen : Subject and Topic for a source
  - 3rd screen : Questions campain screen for a topic

Realm is used to store important or disinterest in question. Question are then sorted by important question, then usual one and eventually the none important ones

# To compile
You need to create your keystore.properties at the root of the project. A file keystore.properties.temp is present to get the requested format

A fabric.properties file must be as well created at the root of APP folder. A file fabric.properties.temp is present to get the requested format

Continious work in progress ;-)

# Known bug
